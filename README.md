# Business Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing sales, customer, and product data using SQL and Power BI/Tableau. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, sales performance, product popularity, and store operations. Data cleaning and preparation are performed first, followed by SQL queries to extract valuable insights, and finally, interactive dashboards are created for data visualization.

## Approach

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Check for missing values in all datasets and handle them by:
     - Imputation for numerical values.
     - Mode imputation for categorical variables.
     - Dropping or flagging rows with critical missing data.
   
2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Convert data types where necessary (e.g., converting date columns to date types, numerical columns to integer/float).
   
3. **Merge Datasets**:
   - Merge different datasets such as sales data with product and customer data to create a unified dataset for analysis.

### Load Data into SQL
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared data will be inserted into an SQL database.
   
2. **SQL Database**:
   - Create tables for each dataset (e.g., `sales`, `products`, `customers`, `stores`, `transactions`) in the SQL database.

3. **SQL INSERT Statements**:
   - Use SQL INSERT statements to load the cleaned data into the corresponding tables.

### Power BI / Tableau Visualization
1. **Connect to SQL Database**:
   - Connect SQL database to Power BI or Tableau for seamless data import.
   
2. **Create Dashboards**:
   - Create interactive dashboards to visualize key business insights such as sales performance, customer segmentation, and store analysis.

### SQL Queries
Develop 10 SQL queries to extract important insights from the database. These queries will be based on the following business questions:

1. **Customer Analysis**:
   - **Demographic Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of customers based on gender, age, location (city, state, country, continent).
   - **Purchase Patterns**: Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.
   - **Segmentation**: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.

2. **Sales Analysis**:
   - **Overall Sales Performance**: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality.
   - **Sales by Product**: Evaluate which products are the top performers in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.
   - **Sales by Store**: Assess the performance of different stores based on sales data.
   - **Sales by Currency**: Examine how different currencies impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.

3. **Product Analysis**:
   - **Product Popularity**: Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.
   - **Profitability Analysis**: Calculate profit margins for products by comparing unit cost and unit price.
   - **Category Analysis**: Analyze sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.

4. **Store Analysis**:
   - **Store Performance**: Evaluate store performance based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data (open date).
   - **Geographical Analysis**: Analyze sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For data storage, cleaning, and querying.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python (Optional)**: For data preprocessing and cleaning tasks, if required.
- **Excel/CSV**: For handling datasets before SQL insertion.
